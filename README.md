# Everywhen (Unofficial) Foundry VTT system

This is an unofficial Foundry VTT system for the *Everywhen* RPG from Filigree Forge, based on *Barbarians of Lemuria* written by Simon Washbourne.

The system has a a relatively low-automation approach, with the focus on a character sheet to manage the basics, the unique initiative and damage tracking, and dice rolling. Targeting and automatic damage stuff is not currently implemented (may be a future wishlist item).

## Todo

* Incorporating encumbrance / weight counting
* Weights and costs for weapons and armor (there, but not wired in yet)
* Localization fixes
* Refactoring and cleanup - ugly hacky code.

## Fixes/Issues

* Vehicle name field too short
* Vehicle sheet image background removal
* Alignment of elements / CSS revisions
