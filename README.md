# Everywhen (Unofficial) Foundry VTT system

This is an unofficial Foundry VTT system for the *Everywhen* RPG from Filigree Forge, based on *Barbarians of Lemuria* written by Simon Washbourne.

The system has a a relatively low-automation approach, with the focus on a character sheet to manage the basics, the unique initiative and damage tracking, and dice rolling. Targeting and automatic damage stuff is not in the cards.

## Todo

* Equipment editing and creation (regular gear; weapons/worn armor are done)
* Tab on character sheet for notes / other stuff (like Gear?)
* Prettifying character sheet
* Localization fixes
* Refactoring - it's spaghetti at the moment
